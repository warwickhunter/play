Restore a deleted file
-----------------------
Find the last commit that affected the given path. As the file isn't in the HEAD commit, this commit must have deleted it.

git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>

Then checkout the version at the commit before.

git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>
