Sync to/from the remote master
--------------------------------
# git pull origin master
# git push origin master

Restore a deleted file
-----------------------
Find the last commit that affected the given path. As the file isn't in the HEAD commit, this commit must have deleted it.

# git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>

Then checkout the version at the commit before.

# git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>

Branching and merging
---------------------
Nice article by Veera Sundar (http://java.dzone.com/articles/git-tutorial-%E2%80%93-branching-and)

List branches
# git branch

Create a new branch and switch to it
# git branch new_feature
# git checkout new_feature

Make your mods in the new_feature branch; commit as many times as you wish

Merge changes back into the master 
# git checkout master
# git merge new_feature
#

Setting the remote branch
--------------------------
If you see a message complaining that this is not the remote origin for the current
branch it can be fixed with this command.

git branch --set-upstream master hub/master
